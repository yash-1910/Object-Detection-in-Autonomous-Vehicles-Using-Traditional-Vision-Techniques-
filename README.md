# Object-Detection-in-Autonomous-Vehicles-Using-Traditional-Vision-Techniques-


Object detection plays a pivotal role in the development of autonomous vehicle systems, where rapid and accurate perception of surroundings is essential for navigation, obstacle avoidance, and safety. This report delves into the application of traditional vision-based techniques for object detection, focusing on **You Only Look Once (YOLO)** and **K-Mean clustering**, both of which are utilized in machine learning pipelines for autonomous driving.

## YOLO: Real-Time Object Detection

**YOLO**, a convolutional neural network-based approach, offers real-time detection by processing entire images in a single pass. This makes it particularly suitable for high-speed environments. YOLO's ability to detect multiple objects with high accuracy has proven advantageous for vehicle perception tasks.

- **Strengths of YOLO:**
  - Real-time detection
  - High-speed processing
  - Multiple object detection in a single pass
  - High accuracy

## K-Means Clustering for Object Localization

In parallel, **K-Means clustering** is used to identify and segment objects by grouping similar pixel values, providing a means of unsupervised classification. This complements YOLO’s supervised detection capabilities by enhancing spatial localization of objects in images.

- **Strengths of K-Means Clustering:**
  - Unsupervised classification
  - Pixel-level segmentation
  - Spatial localization enhancement

## Hybrid Approach: Combining YOLO and K-Means

By combining these two approaches, the system benefits from YOLO's efficiency and K-Means clustering’s spatial localization. This hybrid method enhances the overall detection robustness in complex and dynamic driving scenarios, offering the following advantages:
  
- **Efficiency of YOLO**
- **Precision of K-Means**
- **Improved object detection accuracy**

## Performance Analysis and Results

This report compares the efficacy of these methods across various parameters:

- **Detection Speed**
- **Accuracy**
- **Adaptability to varying environmental conditions** (lighting, weather, etc.)

### Findings:
The hybrid approach, which leverages YOLO’s rapid detection capabilities and K-Means clustering’s spatial precision, has been found to improve object detection accuracy. This balanced solution addresses the demanding needs of autonomous navigation.

## Conclusion

Through experimental results and performance analysis, this report emphasizes the potential for integrating traditional vision-based object detection techniques to advance autonomous vehicle technology. The goal is to contribute toward safer and more reliable self-driving systems.
